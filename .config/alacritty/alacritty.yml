# Mouse bindings
#
# Mouse bindings are specified as a list of objects, much like the key
# bindings further below.
#
# Each mouse binding will specify a:
#
# - `mouse`:
#
#   - Middle
#   - Left
#   - Right
#   - Numeric identifier such as `5`
#
# - `action` (see key bindings)
#
# And optionally:
#
# - `mods` (see key bindings)
mouse_bindings:
 - { mouse: Right, action: PasteSelection }

# Key bindings
#
# Key bindings are specified as a list of objects. Each binding will specify
# a key and modifiers required to trigger it, terminal modes where the binding
# is applicable, and what should be done when the key binding fires. It can
# either send a byte sequnce to the running application (`chars`), execute
# a predefined action (`action`) or fork and execute a specified command plus
# arguments (`command`).
#
# Example:
#   `- { key: V, mods: Command, action: Paste }`
#
# Available fields:
#   - key
#   - mods (optional)
#   - chars | action | command (exactly one required)
#   - mode (optional)
#
# Values for `key`:
#   - `A` -> `Z`
#   - `F1` -> `F12`
#   - `Key1` -> `Key0`
#
#   A full list with available key codes can be found here:
#   https://docs.rs/glutin/*/glutin/enum.VirtualKeyCode.html#variants
#   http://tomaka.github.io/glium_text/glium/glutin/enum.VirtualKeyCode.html

#### https://github.com/shicks/config/blob/21e6f7dca9df9cdc34be5b461954fb9da9f72742/alacritty.yml
# Either an `action`, `chars`, or `command` field must be present.
#   `action` must be one of `Paste`, `PasteSelection`, `Copy`, or `Quit`.
#   `chars` writes the specified string every time that binding is activated.
#     These should generally be escape sequences, but they can be configured to
#     send arbitrary strings of bytes.
#   `command` must be a map containing a `program` string, and `args` array of
#     strings. For example:
#     - { ... , command: { program: "alacritty", args: ["-e", "vttest"] } }
#
# Want to add a binding (e.g. "PageUp") but are unsure what the X sequence
# (e.g. "\x1b[5~") is? Open another terminal (like xterm) without tmux,
# then run `showkey -a` to get the sequence associated to a key combination.

# Note: AppCursor and AppKeypad mode seem to refer to the following:
#   http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO-21.html
# It's not clear to me why I care to send different keys for these modes.
# One place it makes a difference is that shift works differently in AppKeypad
# mode when numlock is off: it does not send numbers, but instead weird
# shifted keycodes (home's ^[OH becomes ^[O2w, for instance), FWIW.
# Other possibly interesting references:
#    http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO-21.html (special keys)
#    https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/manual/en/usage/tips/appkeypad.html
#
# Values for `mods`:
#   - Command
#   - Control
#   - Shift
#   - Alt
#
#   Multiple `mods` can be combined using `|` like this: `mods: Control|Shift`.
#   Whitespace and capitalization is relevant and must match the example.
#
# Values for `chars`:
#   The `chars` field writes the specified string to the terminal. This makes
#   it possible to pass escape sequences.
#   To find escape codes for bindings like `PageUp` ("\x1b[5~"), you can run
#   the command `showkey -a` outside of tmux.
#   Note that applications use terminfo to map escape sequences back to
#   keys. It is therefore required to update the terminfo when
#   changing an escape sequence.
#
# - `action`: Execute a predefined action
#
#   - Copy
#   - Paste
#   - PasteSelection
#   - IncreaseFontSize
#   - DecreaseFontSize

#   - ScrollPageDown

#   - SpawnNewInstance
#   - ClearLogNotice
#   - ReceiveChar
#   - None
#   (macOS only action):
#   - ToggleSimpleFullscreen: Enters fullscreen without occupying another space
#
# - `command`: Fork and execute a specified command plus arguments
#
#    The `command` field must be a map containing a `program` string and an
#    `args` array of command line parameter strings. For example:
#       `{ program: "alacritty", args: ["-e", "vttest"] }`
#
# And optionally:
#
# - `mods`: Key modifiers to filter binding actions
#
#    - Command
#    - Control
#    - Option
#    - Super
#    - Shift
#    - Alt
#
#    Multiple `mods` can be combined using `|` like this:
#       `mods: Control|Shift`.
#    Whitespace and capitalization are relevant and must match the example.
#
# - `mode`: Indicate a binding for only specific terminal reported modes
#
#    This is mainly used to send applications the correct escape sequences
#    when in different modes.
#
#    - AppCursor
#    - AppKeypad
#    - Alt
#
#    A `~` operator can be used before a mode to apply the binding whenever
#    the mode is *not* active, e.g. `~Alt`.
#
# Bindings are always filled by default, but will be replaced when a new
# binding with the same triggers is defined. To unset a default binding, it can
# be mapped to the `ReceiveChar` action. Alternatively, you can use `None` for
# a no-op if you do not wish to receive input characters for that binding.
